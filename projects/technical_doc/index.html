				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of the environment to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Javascript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures and statements. Core Javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing with additional objects. for example,
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Client-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client side extension allow an application to place element in an HTML form and respond to user events mouse click, form input and page navigation. </li>
					<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running Javascript on a server. FOr example, server-side extension allow application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>What you should already know</h1>
				<p>The guide assumes you have the following background.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A general understanding of the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
					<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page.</li>

				<h1 id="javascript_and_java">Javascript and Java</h1>
				<p>
					JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others. The JavaScript language resemble Java but
					does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expresion syntax, naming convetions and
					basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed LiveScript to JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declaration, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
					number of data types respecting numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of
					more common class-object based model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
					what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
					Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed method.
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes and methods. You do not
					have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
					parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="hello-world">
				<h1 id="hello_world">Hello World</h1>
				<p>
					To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratched and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code.
				</p>
				<code>
					function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName);}
				</code>
				<br> <br>
				<code>
					greetMe("World");
				</code>
				<p>
					Select the code in the pad and hit <kbd>ctrl+R</kbd> to watch it unfold in your browser.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="variables">
				<h1>Variables</h1>
				<p>
					You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
					conform to certain rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_) or dollar sign($);
					subsequent characters can also be digits(0-9). Because JavaScript is a case sensitive,
					letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="declaring-variables">
				<h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
				<p>
					you can declare variables in three ways: <br><br>
					with the key word var. for example,
				</p>
				<code>var x = 1;</code>
				<p>
					This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
				</p>
				<p>
					By simply assigning it a value. for Eample,
				</p>
				<code>x = 42;</code>
				<p>
					This always declares a global variable. It generates a script JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the keyword let for example,
				</p>
				<code>
					let x = 34;
				</code>
				<p>
					This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variables. See Variable Scope below.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="variable-scope">
				<h1>Variable scope</h1>
				<p>
					When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code
					in the current document. When you declare a variable withinn a function, it is called a local variable, because the scope of x
					is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block which in this case is an if statement.
				</p>
				<code>
					if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(5) // 5
				</code>
				<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code
					in the current document. When you declare a variable withinn a function, it is called a local variable, because the scope of x
					is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block which in this case is an if statement.
				</p>
				<code>
					if (true) {let y = 5;} console.log(5) // ReferenceError y is not defined
				</code>

			<section class="main-section" id="global-variable">
				<h1>Global variables</h1>
				<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web page the global object is the window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
